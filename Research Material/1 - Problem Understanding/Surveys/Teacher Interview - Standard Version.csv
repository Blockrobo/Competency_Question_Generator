That usually works very well. However, for detailed planning, it’s often not helpful because the tool lacks access to my specific teaching materials and sometimes it’s easy to get lost in too many ideas. I also enjoy using it for writing emails or parent letters, as well as for creating exercises such as true-or-false questions or solution keys.It’s also very helpful for differentiating learning materials, for example by simplifying texts or adapting tasks for students who need more support.","In one lesson, my students struggled more than expected with a science experiment because they focused mainly on the results instead of the process of observing and reasoning. I realized they needed more guidance in formulating hypotheses and interpreting what they saw.

I do of course have preparation time, but I find that with LLMs this can be done much quicker than in the past. I find that I need a few hours on Friday afternoon to prepare for the following week because of the ongoing conversation I have with the LLM. It's much more efficient and productive. For feedback I meet with each student one to one for 20 - 30 minutes each week to get a feeling for how they are absorbing the content of lessons and to see if they need support making progress with their projects.","Several times a week","Various internet sites for research opportunities. I use Youtube a lot when I find engaging videos. I would like to use LLMs more often but want to first learn about how to best use them with the students in a healthy and productive way.","Yes, regularly","As I mentioned above in Question 2.1, I use AI all the time to plan my lessons. I enter in curriculum goals, the subject or content I'd like to explore, and my favorite ideas, books, teachers, and lessons from my own learning. I then have a conversation with the LLM to get ideas for activities or resources to most efficiently plan my lesson. Each week we discuss the progress we are making as a group, the challenges faced in the lessons, and add new ideas that come up over the week per the student's interests and curiosity. I then have a discussion with the LLM to move forward into the next week as fluidly as possible.","I was trying to teach students about the progression of life on earth and realized they were struggling with the large gaps in time between evolutionary progress and change. I adjusted my approach by going into our long activity room and created a to scale timeline of life on earth so they could better grasp how long change can sometimes take, but then once the change happens it gets faster and faster.","Understanding new topics;Applying knowledge;Staying motivated;Managing time;Preparing for assessment","Behavioral signs;Performance on work;Class participation;Student communication","Verbal feedback in class;Peer feedback","We are a project based school so this is managed while helping students set goals and make progress on their individual projects.","Helping struggling students","If students learn how to engage in a healthy way with LLMs it could certainly help with this. If they had their own bot tailored to their needs it would be great. ","Hard to maintain","Given that my subject areas are the humanities my main tracking tool is conversation. If they are able to have a discussion about the topic it is a good sign they are grasping the content. I also have them write about their process of insight and understanding and this writing is also a good way for me to track progress.","Very positive","I have already seen the benefits in terms of planning lessons and I am very excited about this going forward. I am also excited how LLMs will support students individually, but I do feel that the students need to learn about how to use this technology properly and in a healthy way. In themselves these tools can be as damaging as they can be helpful, and it is important that we keep this in mind as we bring it into the classroom.","Student overreliance;Accuracy or misinformation;Data privacy;Accessibility;Academic integrity","Planning of curriculum and lessons for sure. I think there would also be a place to track student progress in a more nuanced way over time. The big trust barrier would be to create individual student learning guide bots.","Classroom Screen","We would need to have the correct allowances for student use.

Just getting info off the screen or copying - pasting is not learning. But an interactive approach bringing in language, visual learning, etc, would be a great addition.","I think the conversation focus would be most helpful. If there is a dialogue there will be tremendous amounts of data that the AI can collect and use in the future to help the students.","Better student results;More engagement;Stronger confidence;Improved independence","As with all powerful tech AI and LLMs have both tremendous potential to do good and cause harm. I am excited about using this technology more and more in the years to come, but I am also a proponent of a gradual and cautious approach. More is not necessarily always better.
