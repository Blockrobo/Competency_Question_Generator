Goal -> To identify needs, challenges, and opportunities for a prompt-based intelligent tutoring system that supports students’ learning in real educational contexts.. 

#### Introduction and Rapport Building
##### Purpose Script
- Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. 
- We’re exploring how an AI-based, prompt-driven chatbot could support students’ learning
- Before we begin, I want to emphasise that you're the expert here -> we're learning from your experience. 
- There are no right or wrong answers, and we're genuinely curious about your perspective.

##### Consent & Logistics
- We'd like to record this to ensure we capture your insights accurately.

##### Warm-up Questions (optional)
1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself and what you teach?
	1. Specifically -> What subjects and grade levels do you teach? 
2. What do you enjoy most about teaching?
3. What's one thing about your classroom or students that makes your work rewarding?

#### Teaching Context & Use of Technology
	Aim: Understand current teaching practices, digital tool use, and attitudes toward technology.

1. Walk me through a typical teaching week
	- What does preparation, class time, and follow-up look like? 
2. Walk me through how you currently use digital tools in a typical lesson.
	- Which are most valuable or frustrating?
3. Have you or your students tried AI tools (like ChatGPT or similar)?
	- Tell me about a time you used one for teaching. What worked or didn't?
	*Follow-ups:* 
		*- What made that experience helpful or unhelpful?*
		*- What needs were you trying to meet with these tools?*

#### Student Learning Needs
	Aim: Explore where students struggle and how teachers identify and support learning challenges.

1. Tell me about a recent lesson that didn't go as planned.
	- How did you notice students were struggling? 
	- What did you do in response?
2. Where do your students usually need extra support?
	- How do you help them? 
	- Do they need assistance outside of class time? If so, how do you help them then?
3. What types of feedback do your students respond to best?
	- Can you share a specific example?
4. How do you handle differences in learning pace, motivation, or ability? 
	- How do you know when a student is falling behind or needs a challenge? 

#### Teaching Challenges
	Aim: Identify pain points and automation opportunities without reducing quality.

1. What parts of your teaching process take up the most time? 
	- Which do you find most valuable?
2. Are there any tasks you think could be automated or simplified?
3. How do you currently track student progress and adjust your teaching? 
4. How do you balance personalisation with limited time or resources?

#### Attitudes Toward AI Tutoring and Prompt-based Support
	Aim: Assess trust, concerns, and expectations regarding AI use in education.

1. How do you feel about the increasing use of AI in education? 
	- What opportunities or concerns come to mind? 
	- What could influence this perspective?
2. What risks worry you about AI tools for students?
	- *Note for interviewer -> academic integrity, misinformation, dependency, equity...*
3. If you could use an AI tool confidently and would be certain about it's reliability, what would you want it to handle?
	- *Note for interviewer -> feedback, practice tasks, personalised explanations...*

#### Integration and Practical Considerations
	Aim: Explore compatibility with existing workflows and systems.

1. How do you currently use your Learning Management System?
	- What works well? 
	- What doesn't?
2. If a new intelligent tutor were introduced, how would it need to fit into your classroom workflow?
3. What would make you feel that a new tool genuinely saves time, not creates extra work? 
4. How might your students interact with such a tool outside of class (what access would they have)?

#### Envisioning Ideal Support
	Aim: Encourage reflective thinking about desired outcomes and success criteria.

1. Imagine a student struggling with new material at home. What kind of help would you ideally want them to have?
2. If you had a magic wand, what would you change about how your students learn outside of class? 
3. What learning outcomes would indicate that an AI assistant is actually helping? 
4. What safeguards or teacher controls would you want built in? 

#### Closing
1. Is there anything important that we haven't discussed that you would like to mention? 
2. Would you be open to testing or reviewing a prototype later on? 
3. Is there anyone else you think we should talk to?
