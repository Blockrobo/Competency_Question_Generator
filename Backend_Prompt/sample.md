# Sample Lesson Content: Introduction to Fake News

## What is Fake News?

Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue.

## How to Spot Fake News

Here are a few tips to help you identify fake news:

*   **Consider the source:** Look at the website where the story is from. Does it look professional? Are there a lot of ads and pop-ups?
*   **Read beyond the headline:** Headlines can be sensational to get clicks. Read the whole story to get the full picture.
*   **Check the author:** Is the author a real person? Do they have a good reputation?
*   **Look for supporting sources:** Does the story cite any sources? If so, check them out.
*   **Check the date:** Is the story recent? Sometimes old news stories are shared as if they are new.
*   **Check your biases:** We are all more likely to believe stories that confirm our own beliefs. Be aware of your own biases and question information that seems too good to be true.

## Activity Idea

Divide students into groups and give them a list of news headlines. Ask them to use the tips above to decide which headlines are likely to be fake news and which are likely to be real. Have them discuss their reasoning with the group.
